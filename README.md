This is supporting information for the *Methods in Ecology and Evolution* article entitled, **Integrated SDM database: enhancing the relevance and utility of species distribution models in conservation management**, by Veronica F. Frans, Amélie A. Augé, Jim Fyfe, Yuqian Zhang, Nathan McNally, Hendrik Edelhoff, Niko Balkenhol, & Jan O. Engler. Please contact the corresponding author, Veronica Frans, for any inquiries.

The *integrated species distribution model database (iSDMdb)* is a spatial, descriptive database of predicted sites in a species’ predicted range, derived from SDM results, that contains additional data fields that synthesise and summarise SDM predictions and uncertainty, potential human impacts, restoration features, novel preferences in novel spaces, and management priorities. Data fields are generated using a wide range of assessments outside traditional SDM procedures, resulting in an enhanced, practical, and accessible decision-making database to guide management.

In this *Methods in Ecology and Evolution* article, an *iSDMdb* was created using the example of the New Zealand sea lion (*Phocarctos hookeri*). Enclosed are the R scripts and HTML versions of Appendix S1-S3, S4-S5, and S8, and the summary results of this case study in Appendix S7. Further information on the *iSDMdb* structure and this case study species can be found at https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13736.
